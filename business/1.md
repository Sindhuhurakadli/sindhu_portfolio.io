###  **1. Hash Tables in Microsoft Outlook (Email Deduplication and Search)**

---

**How Itâ€™s Used:**
Hash tables can be utilized in Microsoft Outlook to:

* Assign unique hash codes to emails for duplicate detection.
* Enable fast contact lookup during typing.
* Accelerate email search by indexing and organizing emails via hash keys.

---

**Challenges:**

* Must deliver real-time performance for smooth user experience.
* Needs to prevent hash collisions, ensuring accuracy in deduplication.

---

**Why Itâ€™s Useful:**

* Faster searches and better email organization.
* Optimizes storage by removing redundant emails.
* Improves overall responsiveness and user satisfaction.

| **Aspect**           | **Details**                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design Technique** | Hashing, Direct Access Table                                                                         |
| **Time Complexity**  | â€¢ Average Case: O(1) â€” for insert, delete, and lookup  <br> â€¢ Worst Case: O(N) â€” if collisions occur |
| **Space Complexity** | O(N), where *N* is the number of stored key-value pairs                                              |

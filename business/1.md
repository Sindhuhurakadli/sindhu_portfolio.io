### **1. Hash Tables in Microsoft Outlook (Email Deduplication and Search)**

**How it's used:**

Hash tables in Microsoft Outlook can be used to improve performance by giving each email a unique code, which makes it easy to detect and remove duplicates. They also speed up contact lookup when typing names or email addresses and make searching through emails faster by organizing and indexing them efficiently.

**Challenges:**

* Must be very fast so Outlook feels smooth.
* Needs to avoid mix-ups where different emails get the same code.

**Why itâ€™s useful:**

* Faster email search and better organization.
* Saves space by removing repeated emails.
* Improves user experience, making Outlook quicker and easier to use.

 **Algorithms, Design Techniques, Performance Analysis:**

* **Design Technique:** Hashing, Direct Access Table
* **Time Complexity:**
  * **Average Case:** O(1) for insert, delete, and lookup
  * **Worst Case:** O(N) (when many keys collide and are stored in a list or tree)
* **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of key-value pairs

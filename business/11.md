### **11. Modular Inverse in Azure Key Vault & Encryption**

**Application in Microsoft:**
Modular Inverse is crucial in Azure Key Vault and other cryptographic services that rely on RSA encryption/decryption, digital signatures, and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). It is used to compute the multiplicative inverse modulo `n`, essential in private key operations like computing `d` in RSA where $ed \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)$.

**Challenges:**

* Secure key generation and private key recovery
* Ensuring operations are resistant to timing attacks
* Precision and efficiency in large-number arithmetic

**Market Benefits:**

* Secure encryption/decryption with strong mathematical guarantees
* Enables digital signatures and authentication protocols
* Integral to RSA key lifecycle management in Azure Key Vault

**Algorithms, Design Techniques, Performance Analysis:**

* **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** for modular inverse

* **Used in:** RSA decryption, ECC signature generation, Azure Key Vault, Azure Confidential Ledger

* **Time Complexity:** O(log n)

* **Space Complexity:** O(1) (constant extra space)

## **17. Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**


**Application in Microsoft:**
**Deques** can be used in various Microsoft products and services where efficient insertion and removal from both ends are needed:

* **Microsoft Teams:** Deques can be used to manage recent messages or chat history, allowing quick addition of new messages at the front or back, and removal of old messages as the chat window scrolls.

* **Microsoft Edge Browser:** Deques can handle browser history navigation, enabling fast forward and backward traversal with efficient update of history entries at both ends.

* **Windows OS Task Scheduling:** Deques can be applied in process scheduling queues or event handling systems where tasks are added or removed dynamically from either end.


**Challenges:**

* Maintaining efficient O(1) operations for both ends without overhead
* Handling concurrent access in multi-threaded environments (like chat or browser tabs)
* Ensuring memory efficiency when storing large or dynamic data


**Market Benefits:**

* Fast, responsive UI experiences with smooth chat and browsing history navigation
* Improved system responsiveness in task and event scheduling
* Efficient resource management in real-time applications

  [17] Double ended queue
  <br>
</p><br>


**Algorithms, Design Techniques, Performance Analysis:**

* **Technique:** Doubly linked list or circular buffer-based deque

* **Design:** Supports enqueue and dequeue operations at both front and back ends

* **Used in:**

  * Microsoft Teams (recent messages buffering)
  * Microsoft Edge (forward/back navigation history)
  * Windows OS (task scheduling and event queues)

* **Time Complexity:**

  * Insertion (front/back): O(1)
  * Deletion (front/back): O(1)

* **Space Complexity:** O(n), where *n* is the number of elements in the deque

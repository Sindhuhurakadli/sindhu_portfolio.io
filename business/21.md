## **21. Stable Marriage Problem for Optimized Matching in Microsoft Recruitment and Azure Scheduling**

---

**Application in Microsoft:**

Stable Marriage Problem can be used in Microsoft systems that require optimal matching between two parties based on preferences or constraints. It plays a vital role in:

* **Microsoft Hiring Platforms:** Matching candidates to suitable job openings or interviewers based on skill fit and preferences, ensuring optimal placements with minimized mismatch.
* **Azure Resource Scheduling:** Assigning virtual machines to physical servers or workloads to compute nodes based on compatibility and performance profiles.
* **Microsoft Teams Meeting Scheduler:** Pairing participants with optimal meeting times and rooms based on availability and preference ranking.

---

**Challenges:**

* Ensuring stability across dynamic preference changes
* Handling incomplete preference lists or priority conflicts
* Scaling the algorithm to enterprise-scale workloads and candidate pools

---

**Why Itâ€™s Useful:**

* Improved match quality in recruitment and scheduling systems
* Reduced churn in team allocation and interviewer assignments
* Higher resource utilization in Azure and scheduling services

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Technique        | Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm (Deferred Acceptance algorithm)                                     |
| Used in          | Microsoft hiring portals, Azure VM-to-server mapping, Microsoft Teams meeting coordination |
| Time Complexity  | O(nÂ²), where *n* is the number of participants in each group                               |
| Space Complexity | O(nÂ²), mainly for storing preference matrices                                              |

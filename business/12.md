### **12. Fermat’s Little Theorem in Azure Cryptographic Protocols**

**Application in Microsoft:**
Fermat’s Little Theorem is used in Azure’s cryptographic functions, especially in modular exponentiation, primality testing, and efficient inverse computation when the modulus is a prime number. It's commonly applied in RSA, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and signature schemes.

**Challenges:**

* Efficient primality testing for key generation
* Performing large exponentiations with modular constraints
* Ensuring randomness and security in key operations

**Market Benefits:**

* Speeds up cryptographic computations
* Reduces computational cost of public key operations
* Strengthens security with mathematically sound checks

**Algorithms, Design Techniques, Performance Analysis:**

* Fermat's Little Theorem: $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$

* Used for fast exponentiation, modular inverses (with prime moduli)

* **Used in:** RSA/ECC in Azure Key Vault, Azure TLS handshakes, Azure IoT Hub encryption

* **Time Complexity:** O(log p) for modular exponentiation

* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## **20. Bitmasking Can Be Used for Configuration State Management in Office 365 Optimization**

---

**Application in Microsoft:**

Bitmasking can be used in Office 365 to manage multiple configuration states such as user permissions, plugin settings, and feature toggles. It allows:

* Compact representation of multiple options
* Fast enabling, disabling, and checking of states
* Efficient handling of combinations using bitwise operations
  
---

**Challenges:**

* Exponential state space with many options
* Complexity in debugging bit-level logic
* Scalability in dynamic configuration systems
  
---

**Why It‚Äôs Useful:**

* Faster configuration evaluation
* Reduced memory usage
* Improved user responsiveness through quick state changes

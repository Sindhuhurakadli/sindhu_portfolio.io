### **13 Prime Factorization in Azure Key Lifecycle Management (RSA Security)**

**Application in Microsoft:**
Prime Factorization underlies the security of RSA, used in Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, and Azure confidential computing. Though Azure never factors primes directly, the difficulty of factorization ensures the hardness of breaking RSA keys (i.e., computing `d` without knowing the primes `p`, `q`).

**Challenges:**

* Generating large, secure primes for RSA keys
* Preventing factorization attacks using quantum or lattice-based methods
* Safeguarding keys against side-channel leaks

**Market Benefits:**

* Foundation of modern public-key security
* Ensures trust in secure access control and identity verification
* Vital for data protection, secure messaging, and trusted certificate chains

**Algorithms, Design Techniques, Performance Analysis:**

* RSA security depends on infeasibility of factoring $n = pq$

* Key generation uses probabilistic prime generation, not direct factorization

* **Used in:** Azure Key Vault RSA keys, SSL/TLS in Azure Web Apps, Microsoft Defender Key Signing

* **Time Complexity (Factorization):**

  * Classical: Super-polynomial (e.g., $e^{(n \log n)^{1/3}}$)
  * Quantum (Shor's Algorithm): Polynomial (not yet practical at scale)

* **Space Complexity:** Varies with method

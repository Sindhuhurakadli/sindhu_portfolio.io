###  **13. Prime Factorization in Azure Key Lifecycle Management (RSA Security)**

---

**How itâ€™s used:**
Prime factorization underpins the security of RSA cryptography, critical in Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, and Azure confidential computing. While Azure never factors primes directly, the hardness of prime factorization ensures RSA key security by making it infeasible to derive private keys without the original prime factors.

---

**Application in Microsoft:**

* Securing RSA key pairs in Azure Key Vault.
* Enabling secure identity verification and access control in Azure Active Directory.
* Protecting SSL/TLS certificates in Azure Web Apps and Microsoft Defender key signing.

---

**Challenges:**

* Generating large, cryptographically strong primes for RSA keys.
* Preventing factorization attacks, including emerging quantum threats.
* Protecting keys against side-channel and leakage attacks.

---

**Why itâ€™s useful:**

* Foundation for modern public-key security and trust models.
* Enables secure communication, authentication, and data encryption.
* Ensures compliance with stringent security and privacy standards.

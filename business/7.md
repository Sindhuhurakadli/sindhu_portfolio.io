### **7. Priority Queues for Job Prioritization in Microsoft Azure**

**Application in Microsoft:**
Microsoft Azure can use priority queues to schedule and prioritize cloud jobs, tasks, and virtual machine requests. For example, Azure Batch or Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) schedules tasks based on urgency, user-defined priority, and system resource availability using a heap-based priority queue.

**Challenges:**

* Efficient task scheduling in massively distributed systems
* Fair resource allocation among competing jobs
* Supporting preemption, dynamic scaling, and SLA-based dispatching

**Market Benefits:**

* Improved resource utilization and task throughput
* Better support for real-time, mission-critical applications
* Higher customer satisfaction via SLA adherence and fast response

  [9] Priority Queues for job prioritization in microsoft azure.
  <br>
</p><br>
**Algorithms, Design Techniques, Performance Analysis:**

* Min-Heap / Max-Heap implementation of Priority Queues

* Tasks/jobs ordered by custom priority scores or timestamps

* Used in: Azure Batch Scheduler, Azure Functions runtime, AKS, and VM provisioning logic

* **Time Complexity:**

  * Insertion into Priority Queue: O(log N)
  * Fetch highest/lowest priority task: O(1)
  * Deletion (pop): O(log N)

* **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N = number of active jobs/tasks in the queue

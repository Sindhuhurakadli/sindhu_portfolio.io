## **2.Segment Trees in Microsoft (Azure Monitoring and Analytics)**

Can be used in Microsoft Azure to analyze system logs or monitor metrics like CPU or memory usage over time. Segment trees make it easy to quickly calculate things like the average CPU usage between two time points, even when handling large amounts of data.

**Challenges:**
Handling large and constantly changing datasets while still giving fast results for real-time dashboards.

**Market Benefits:**

* Faster dashboard updates with live metrics.
* Better real-time analytics for users to monitor and respond to system issues quickly.

### **Algorithms, Design Techniques, and Performance Analysis**

* **Technique:** Divide and Conquer
* **Enhancement:** Lazy Propagation (for efficient range updates)
* **Time Complexity:** O(log N) per query or update, where N is the number of data points
* **Space Complexity:** O(N)

### ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Segment Trees in Microsoft Azure (Monitoring and Analytics)**

---

**How it‚Äôs used:**
In Microsoft Azure, Segment Trees can be utilized for analyzing system performance metrics such as CPU, memory, or network usage over time. When users request insights like the average load or peak usage between two points, segment trees allow these range queries to be executed efficiently, even as data continues to stream in real time.

---

**Challenges:**

* Supporting fast and accurate queries on continuously updated time-series data.
* Maintaining low-latency operations while monitoring large-scale cloud environments.

---

**Why it‚Äôs useful:**

* Enables real-time performance tracking and faster issue detection.
* Improves responsiveness of analytics dashboards without requiring complete data scans.
* Supports scalable infrastructure for enterprise-level telemetry and observability.

### **1. Hash Tables in Microsoft Outlook (Email Deduplication and Search)**

**How it's used:**

Hash tables in Microsoft Outlook can be used to improve performance by giving each email a unique code, which makes it easy to detect and remove duplicates. They also speed up contact lookup when typing names or email addresses and make searching through emails faster by organizing and indexing them efficiently.

**Challenges:**

* Must be **very fast** so Outlook feels smooth.
* Needs to avoid **mix-ups** where different emails get the same code.

**Why it‚Äôs useful:**

* **Faster email search and better organization.**
* **Saves space** by removing repeated emails.
* **Improves user experience**, making Outlook quicker and easier to use.

  <br>
</p><br>

 **Algorithms, Design Techniques, Performance Analysis:**

* **Design Technique:** Hashing, Direct Access Table
* **Time Complexity:**
  * **Average Case:** O(1) for insert, delete, and lookup
  * **Worst Case:** O(N) (when many keys collide and are stored in a list or tree)
* **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of key-value pairs

### **Segment Trees in Microsoft (Azure Monitoring and Analytics)**

**Can be used** in Microsoft Azure to analyze system logs or monitor metrics like CPU or memory usage over time. Segment trees make it easy to quickly calculate things like the average CPU usage between two time points, even when handling large amounts of data.

**Challenges:**
Handling **large and constantly changing datasets** while still giving fast results for real-time dashboards.

**Market Benefits:**

* **Faster dashboard updates** with live metrics.
* **Better real-time analytics** for users to monitor and respond to system issues quickly.

### **Algorithms, Design Techniques, and Performance Analysis**

* **Technique:** Divide and Conquer
* **Enhancement:** Lazy Propagation (for efficient range updates)
* **Time Complexity:** O(log N) per query or update, where N is the number of data points
* **Space Complexity:** O(N), because it stores extra information for each segment in a tree structure

### **Tries in Microsoft Word (Spell Checking and Autocomplete)**

Tries can be used in Microsoft Word to store dictionary words in a way that allows fast and efficient lookup based on prefixes. Tries (also called prefix trees) help Word quickly check if a word is spelled correctly and offer suggestions as you type.

**Application in Microsoft:**
Tries store thousands of dictionary words in a tree-like structure, where each node represents a character. This allows Word to instantly find all words that begin with a certain prefix, making features like **spell check**, **autocomplete**, and **word suggestions** very fast and accurate.

**Challenges:**
Managing the storage and fast retrieval of **hundreds of thousands of words**, while keeping the memory usage efficient and ensuring **prefix-based search** works instantly.

**Market Benefits:**

* **Real-time typing assistance** through fast and smart word suggestions.
* **Accurate spell checking**, improving writing quality.
* **Enhanced user experience**, especially for fast typers and professional writers.

### **Algorithms, Design Techniques, and Performance Analysis**

* **Data Structure:** Trie (Prefix Tree)
* **Design Technique:** Character-based hierarchical tree
* **Time Complexity:** O(L) per operation (L = length of the word or prefix)
* **Space Complexity:** O(N √ó L), where N is the number of words stored, and L is the average length of words (because each character needs its own node in the tree)
